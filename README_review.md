# SQL-challenge

Testing SQL knowledge and skills.

Looooove me some SQL.  To begin we were given six CSV files and a list of questions to answer.
The CSV's are well sorted and import perfectly into the tables I created.  Just read them, create
a table for each CSV, make sure each column is formatted correctly to hold the strings or integers
or dates within, set the primary and foreign keys, and import to the CSV's to the tables.

The requirement to create an ERD was more useful than I was expecting.  Not to say I thought it
was pointless, but I didn't realize ahead of time that I'd be glued to it when trying to decide
how to join tables.  I now highly recommend them!

With the tables ready and the visual in hand, joining the tables to get the answers needed wasn't
all that difficult.  The scripts can be seen in the 'queries.sql' file, and the questions they
correspond to are in the 'README_instructions.md' file.  I don't have these commands perfectly
memorized yet, but SQL is refershingly... straightforward?  In other challenges in my repository
I've struggled at times to figure out the right commands to input.  In SQL things feel more
intuitive and it's not difficult to search how to pull specific information from your tables
and columns.  It's a lot of fun!

I am aware it's bad form to not all caps the command portions of the code.  Sorry.
