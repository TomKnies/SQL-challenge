## SQL Challenge
For this exercise we were given several different .csv's of company roster information including but not limited to: department, salary, title, name, and position.
Using pdAmdin, I made tables for each .csv using the lines I saved to the table_schemata.sql file in the EmployeesSQL folder.

After importing the .csv's to the tables, I connected primary and foreign keys as seen in the picture below to link the information in all of the tables together.

The full list of requests and queries to answer them can be found in README_instructions.md and EmployeeSQL/queries.sql files respectively.  Just to show an example,
request #1 was to list the following details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, gender, and salary.  The picture below shows the command I used
and a small part of the table created in answer to the query.

## Conclusion
Using SQL to catalogue, filter, and analyze data is a lot of fun.  It's not too different from putting together a good puzzle or solving a crossword or Sudoku for me.
I'm sure the program is capable of even more than I realize and I look forward to learning more about it.
