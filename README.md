## SQL Challenge
For this exercise we were given several different .csv's of company roster information including but not limited to: department, salary, title, name, and position.
Using pdAmdin, I made tables for each .csv using the lines I saved to the table_schemata.sql file in the EmployeesSQL folder.

After importing the .csv's to the tables, I connected primary and foreign keys as seen in the picture below to link the information in all of the tables together.
